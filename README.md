# Supply Chain Logistic - Delay Prediction
Supply chain logistics is the process of managing the flow of goods, information, and resources required to move products from suppliers to end consumers.
# Content
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict delays in supply chain logistics, helping businesses optimize their operations and improve delivery accuracy.
# Steps taken to complete this project:
1. Understanding the data background: Identified project objectives and defined key data points.
2. Data preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset to ensure high-quality input.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained insights into patterns and relationships within the data.
4. Feature engineering: Extracted and selected meaningful features to enhance model performance.
5. Modeling: Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models to predict delays.
6. Summary and recommendations: Provided actionable insights and strategies for implementation.

This project combines technical expertise and problem-solving to address real-world supply chain challenges. It highlights my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
